Handylight
==========

Handylight is a iOS iPhone app which I used to teach myself iOS development. I did submit the app but 
do to the high number of Flashlight apps and with iOS7 having a build in Flashlight it was rejected. 

List of things I learned while building
---------------------------------------

- Build in Social methods for Facebook and Twitter
- Email to share app
- UIAlertview with multiple buttons
- Storyboard
- Navigation Bar
- iAds
- Google Admob
- importing and using third party Classes such as Admob and KnobViewSensor
- Delegates 
- Transition between views with Modal Trasitions
- and much more
